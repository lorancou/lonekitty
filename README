  WHAT WOULD HAVE HELPED
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- vector math lib
- collisions lib
- sound lib, browser support for the Audio class is *POOR*
  => SoundManager2 looks allright, but could get it to work (snif)
- anim lib

  KNOWN ISSUES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- SFXs won't play with my version of Iceweasel
- SFX sometimes won't play, or sometimes scratch with my version of Chromium, it
  happens that they stop the music, too
- Zooming with Chromium crashes the game :-/ OK with Iceweasel though.
